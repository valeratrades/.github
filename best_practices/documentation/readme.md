A project should have a _short_ one-page readme that is mostly links to more topical documentation. The two most important links are the user docs and the dev docs.

A common failure is a readme growing haphazardly by accretion, such that it is neither a good landing page, nor a source of comprehensive docs on any particular topic. It is hard to refactor such an unstructured readme later. The information is valuable, if disorganized, but there isn't any better place to move it to.
