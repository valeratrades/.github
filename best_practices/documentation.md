## docs/
[developer docs](<https://matklad.github.io/2024/03/22/basic-things.html#:~:text=move%20it%20to.-,Developer%20Docs,-For%20developers%2C%20you>) should _also_ contain a short landing page describing the structure of the documentation. This structure should allow for both a small number of high quality curated documents, and a large number of ad-hoc append-only notes on any particular topic. For example, docs/README.md could point to carefully crafted ARCHITECTURE.md and [CONTRIBUTING.md](#contributing.md), and explicitly say that everything else in the docs/ folder is a set of unorganized topical guides.

### CONTRIBUTING.md
Describes social architecture and [processes](<https://matklad.github.io/2024/03/22/basic-things.html#:~:text=for%20similar%20purposes.-,Process%20Docs,-There%20are%20many>)

### ARCHITECTURE.md
[Must have](<https://matklad.github.io/2021/02/06/ARCHITECTURE.md.html>)

### README.md
- short one-page README that is mostly links to more topical documentation. [The two most important links are the user docs and the dev docs.](<https://matklad.github.io/2024/03/22/basic-things.html>)
