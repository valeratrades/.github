Use github issues for all todos. Difference in urgency is marked by linking each issue to according [milestone](<https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones>). Issues related to bugs should NOT be linked to any milestones (as it messes up the %done counter), but [labeled](<https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels>) as bugs.

Earlier on I used to create a local `TODO.md` file in which I'd track all target tasks for different version. Using github issues is a direct superset.
