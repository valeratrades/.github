== Prefixes
Adopted commit prefixes in my repositories are as follows:

- "feat:"
- "fix:"
- "chore:"
- "style:"
- "test:"
- "refactor:"
- "perf:"
- "docs:"

TODO: sync these from defined -p flags in [~/s/help_scripts/git.sh]

And a special commit message "_", interchangeable with "minor", indicating that the change is too small or insignificant to be mentioned

Every degree of specification is separated by ":" or ": ", so a commit with changed description of project structure could be titled as `docs: architecture: modules` or `docs: architecture`.
