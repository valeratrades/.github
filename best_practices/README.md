# Best Practices
Single-truth source for coding practices adapted in my repositories

## But
Currently everything is simply stolen from following sources:
- [matklad](<https://matklad.github.io/>)
- [boats](<https://without.boats>)
- [adolfo](<https://ochagavia.nl/blog/>)
- [amos](<https://fasterthanli.me/>)
- [arias](<https://faultlore.com/blah/>)
- [holk](<https://theincredibleholk.org/>)
- [kobzol](<https://kobzol.github.io/>)
- [small cult](<https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/>)
- [manishearth](<https://manishearth.github.io/>)
- [bubblebox](<https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2024/04/14/bubblebox.html>)
- [tavinari](<https://tavianator.com/2024/btrfs_bug.html>)

- [nilstriebs](<https://blog.nilstrieb.dev/>)
- [alice ryhl](<https://ryhl.io/>)
- [blaz](<https://blaz.is/blog/>)
- [vorpus](<https://vorpus.org/blog/archives.html>) with [go, async and goto](<https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/>) and [trio](<https://github.com/python-trio/trio>)

And possibly textbooks https://teachyourselfcs.com/, https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/index and so on

Equally so, many things outlined are a general counsel, but within the realms of this repo many (like process_docs) could be expanded to a more concrete form to be directly linked from every one of my repositories)
